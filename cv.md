### Briefly About Myself

For many years I have worked with various technical systems, including the most complex automatic control systems, including artificial intelligence with elements of machine learning and deep learning. Observing from the inside the dynamics of development of the technology of production and information processes, I was convinced that the future belongs to various information technologies. Therefore, I decided to become a participant in the processes of creating our technological future in order to increase the efficiency of production processes, reduce energy costs, and improve the quality of life.
I am sure that my interest in learning new skills and the ability to dive deeply into the subject will allow me to master the profession of Frontend developer to perfection.
